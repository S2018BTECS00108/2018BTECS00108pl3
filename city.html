                Jaysingpur is a city and municipal council in the Kolhapur district of the Indian state of Maharashtra. The city derives its name from Raja Jaysing, the father of Shrimant Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur, who planned and developed the architecture of the city.Shahu Maharaj laid out Jaysingpur as one of the few "chess board cities" in Maharashtra where roads meet at 90-degree angles.
